# RISC-V-Single-Cycle-Core-on-FPGA
This repository contains a Verilog HDL implementation of a 32-bit RISC-V Single-Cycle Processor (RV32I), designed for the Basys 3 FPGA. It uses Block RAM (BRAM) for instruction memory and includes Integrated Logic Analyzer (ILA) integration for real-time debugging.
